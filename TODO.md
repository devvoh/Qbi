Qbi To-do list
===

- Tasks need to be able to be set to run on a schedule as well as an interval. There should be a DateTime set for intervalStart, and then an interval.
- Triggers and Tasks need to be able to delay their action. A player joined? Wait a second or two before doing something. The server needs to go down? A task needs to be able to set a timer for [x] minutes, send messages every so often, then kill the server, run the map update, and once that's done, start the server again.
- More descriptive exceptions/errors and a nice error handler. Maybe not die on Errors.
